# Tool & Function Calling

> Use tools (or functions) in your prompts with OpenRouter. Learn how to use tools with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other models that support tool calling.

Tool calls (also known as function calls) give an LLM access to external tools. The LLM does not call the tools directly. Instead, it suggests the tool to call. The user then calls the tool separately and provides the results back to the LLM. Finally, the LLM formats the response into an answer to the user's original question.

OpenRouter standardizes the tool calling interface across models and providers, making it easy to integrate external tools with any supported model.

**Supported Models**: You can find models that support tool calling by filtering on [openrouter.ai/models?supported\_parameters=tools](https://openrouter.ai/models?supported_parameters=tools).

## Request Body Examples

Tool calling with OpenRouter involves three key steps. Here are the essential request body formats for each step:

### Step 1: Inference Request with Tools

```json
{
  "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
        "description": "Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "search_terms": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {"type": "string"},
              "description": "List of search terms to find books"
            }
          },
          "required": ["search_terms"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Tool Execution (Client-Side)

After receiving the model's response with `tool_calls`, execute the requested tool locally and prepare the result:

```javascript
// Model responds with tool_calls, you execute the tool locally
const toolResult = await searchGutenbergBooks(["James", "Joyce"]);
```

### Step 3: Inference Request with Tool Results

```json
{
  "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": null,
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "id": "call_abc123",
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
            "arguments": "{\"search_terms\": [\"James\", \"Joyce\"]}"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "tool",
      "tool_call_id": "call_abc123",
      "content": "[{\"id\": 4300, \"title\": \"Ulysses\", \"authors\": [{\"name\": \"Joyce, James\"}]}]"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
        "description": "Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "search_terms": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {"type": "string"},
              "description": "List of search terms to find books"
            }
          },
          "required": ["search_terms"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: The `tools` parameter must be included in every request (Steps 1 and 3) so the router can validate the tool schema on each call.

### Tool Calling Example

Here is Python code that gives LLMs the ability to call an external API -- in this case Project Gutenberg, to search for books.

First, let's do some basic setup:

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    import { OpenRouter } from '@openrouter/sdk';

    const OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "{{API_KEY_REF}}";

    // You can use any model that supports tool calling
    const MODEL = "{{MODEL}}";

    const openRouter = new OpenRouter({
      apiKey: OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
    });

    const task = "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?";

    const messages = [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: task,
      }
    ];
    ```

    ```python
    import json, requests
    from openai import OpenAI

    OPENROUTER_API_KEY = f"{{API_KEY_REF}}"

    # You can use any model that supports tool calling
    MODEL = "{{MODEL}}"

    openai_client = OpenAI(
      base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      api_key=OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
    )

    task = "What are the titles of some James Joyce books?"

    messages = [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": task,
      }
    ]
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

### Define the Tool

Next, we define the tool that we want to call. Remember, the tool is going to get *requested* by the LLM, but the code we are writing here is ultimately responsible for executing the call and returning the results to the LLM.

<Template
  data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: 'google/gemini-2.0-flash-001'
}}
>
  <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript SDK"
    async function searchGutenbergBooks(searchTerms: string[]): Promise<Book[]> {
      const searchQuery = searchTerms.join(' ');
      const url = 'https://gutendex.com/books';
      const response = await fetch(`${url}?search=${searchQuery}`);
      const data = await response.json();

      return data.results.map((book: any) => ({
        id: book.id,
        title: book.title,
        authors: book.authors,
      }));
    }

    const tools = [
      {
        type: 'function',
        function: {
          name: 'searchGutenbergBooks',
          description:
            'Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library based on specified search terms',
          parameters: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
              search_terms: {
                type: 'array',
                items: {
                  type: 'string',
                },
                description:
                  "List of search terms to find books in the Gutenberg library (e.g. ['dickens', 'great'] to search for books by Dickens with 'great' in the title)",
              },
            },
            required: ['search_terms'],
          },
        },
      },
    ];

    const TOOL_MAPPING = {
      searchGutenbergBooks,
    };
    ```

    ```python
    def search_gutenberg_books(search_terms):
        search_query = " ".join(search_terms)
        url = "https://gutendex.com/books"
        response = requests.get(url, params={"search": search_query})

        simplified_results = []
        for book in response.json().get("results", []):
            simplified_results.append({
                "id": book.get("id"),
                "title": book.get("title"),
                "authors": book.get("authors")
            })

        return simplified_results

    tools = [
      {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
          "name": "search_gutenberg_books",
          "description": "Search for books in the Project Gutenberg library based on specified search terms",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "search_terms": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "description": "List of search terms to find books in the Gutenberg library (e.g. ['dickens', 'great'] to search for books by Dickens with 'great' in the title)"
              }
            },
            "required": ["search_terms"]
          }
        }
      }
    ]

    TOOL_MAPPING = {
        "search_gutenberg_books": search_gutenberg_books
    }
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Interleaved Thinking

Interleaved thinking allows models to reason between tool calls, enabling more sophisticated decision-making after receiving tool results. This feature helps models chain multiple tool calls with reasoning steps in between and make nuanced decisions based on intermediate results.

**Important**: Interleaved thinking increases token usage and response latency. Consider your budget and performance requirements when enabling this feature.
